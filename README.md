# Things that I designed and created and don't see a reason why not to share it.

Some of my designs can be found on thingiverse or printables, but usually I just uploaded some parts of them.


Note: This doesn't contain any (job)work related things, where I worked and work. Most of those work related files contain only in-company URLs and some processing that would without future explanation be useless or not be possible to be used elsewhere.
