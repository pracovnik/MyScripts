Obsolete ...

TrueCAM A8 (car dashboard camera) created an own nmea form of files, that contained the GPS location points of where the car was (tracks). I wanted to have a gpx file form, so that I could use it for export.
I could not find more information about transforming-recalculating the numbers, so via try and verify, I made a script to transform into gpx form. 
Imported the created gpx files into a website, that showed the tracks on a map. Those points (tracks) made a nice end-of-year summary map, where the car was.



Note that a recalculation was required. Simple copy paste of strings/numbers from text put the GPS coordinations to a different location.
