SONY smart phone related

I upload pictures to my cloud storage. Sony name their photoes as DSC0001.jpg . Issue I stumbled upon, was that if there was a DSC0010.jpg missing (file name), it reused that name.
After upload+delete, I ended with names that were rewriting older files (same names) or hard to detect what they are for.

So I made a rewrite script using tag "Photo taken", which contain date and time when was a photo taken. And this was used as base for name of the file. Is run regularly, therefore I do not hit conflicts or anomalies anymore
