Inspired by the spammers and hackers ... this is a crontab executed script, that is run regularly, and check a content on public visible website. As I have access to the public website, I can change the content there. The script opens the content on the public website and if it contains specific words, it does and action.

Reason was that few times I could not connect to my server, but I see it as running (ssh open, but connection doesn't continue). So I needed an independet run of a reboot.
