Inspired by the spammers and hackers ... this is a crontab started script, that is run regularly, and check a public website. As I have access the public website, I can change the content there.
The script opens the content on the public website and if it contains specific words, it does and action.

Reason was that few times I could not connect to my server, but I see it as running (ssh open, but connection is halted). So I needed an independet run of a reboot.
