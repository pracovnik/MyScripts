This script is more related to work.

When I do a reboot or restart of machine/software, I want to know when it is up (when started). 
So this is just a simple script that run a cycle, that check regularly IP:port if is open. If open it hold and wait for user's input(key press).


Usual use-case was, I do a reboot and run this script. I put the powershell window on other LCD and do stuff on main LCD. When it reported as online, I continue with it.

The other script is more for a server farm, when I want to check a bunch of machines (ip+port).
