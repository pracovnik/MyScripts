Using dll from: https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp

I got a lot of mp3s from different sources. As my car utilize mp3's tags, I wanted to make them more nicer.
- use same tag picture due to use in car during night. Too light/white pictures are not good as they affect the light during driving
- remove numbers in name and names of mp3. I do not need to know the number ID of a song
- try to add a name of file, if tag has it but not the name of the file.
