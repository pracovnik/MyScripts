I have a csv file, that contains important days of my family (birthdays...)

This script created from the csv file an ICS (ical/icalendar type) file that I could import into my phone calendar.
I had it set, so that I can create a ics file only for specific person, like for my brother (not including people from wife's family).

I didn't wanted a repeating of events, as somethimes I had issue with synchronization (duplicates or lost all)
